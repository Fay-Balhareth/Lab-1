# 1. Data Types Conversion Exercise
Task: Write a script to convert between different data types (e.g., int to float, list to tuple).
Hint: Use built-in functions like int(), float(), list(), tuple().
Example: Convert a list of integers into a tuple of floats.

# 2. List Manipulation Exercise
Task: Create a list of numbers, then write a function to perform operations like adding a number, removing a number, and finding the index of a number.
Hint: Use methods like append(), remove(), index().
Example: Start with a list [1, 2, 3], add 4, remove 2, and find the index of 3.

# 3. Dictionary Operations Exercise
Task: Create a dictionary representing a phone book, then add, remove, and modify entries.
Hint: Use keys for names and values for phone numbers.
Example: Start with an empty phone book, add three new contacts, delete one, and change a number.

# 4. String Formatting Exercise
Task: Write a script that takes user input and formats it in a specific way (e.g., date formatting).
Hint: Use string methods like split(), join(), and formatting techniques.
Example: Convert "2024-01-29" to "January 29, 2024"

# 5. Numpy Array Operations Exercise
Task: Create a numpy array, perform operations like sum, mean, and reshape.
Hint: Use numpy functions like sum(), mean(), reshape().
Example: Create an array of shape (2, 5), calculate its sum, and reshape it to (5, 2).

# 6. Basic Matplotlib Plotting Exercise
Task: Use matplotlib to plot a simple line graph and a scatter plot.
Hint: Use plt.plot() for line graphs and plt.scatter() for scatter plots.
Example: Plot y = x^2 as a line graph and random points as a scatter plot.
